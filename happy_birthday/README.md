# Ain't this an already-well-written melody?
Sort of. Maybe I'm not a good googler, but no matter how hard I try to search for "happy birthday full version" (the one including the "most forgotten/ignored part" of the melody), I either ended up with a very nice but incomplete music-box version, or a full version that is not well-performed. That's why I set out to rewrite the happy birthday melody from scratch, as if how I want it to sound.

Feel free to modify the melody to your will. No two brains are the same, and there are many ways to play this melody. One thing for sure, this happy birthday melody has been out there for a very long time, and I don't even know who created it in the first place.
