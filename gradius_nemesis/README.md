# Where does this melody comes from?
![alt text](https://github.com/thanghn90/open-source-melodies/blob/main/gradius_nemesis/gradius.png)

It's from the game Gradius, a side-scrolling shooting game similar to Chicken Invaders - if you are old enough to know it. This melody is from the very first stage of the original game, and is named "challenger 1985" (because that's when the game was first released - see how old it is?). Original author is Miki Higashino: https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Challenger_1985. The in-game melody is fun and vivid. You won't believe how many times people have remixed this melody. Yet, I'm slow, so I converted it into a slow, relaxing version of piano. If you can contact Miki Higashino, tell her that her work 37 years ago is still inspiring some new music rewriting.

Feel free to modify the melody to your will, but I don't think you should, because trust me, I've tried. A single note deviation might ruin the entire melody.
