# What is this?
A repo of different melodies rewritten in Musescore and OpenMPT format. Completely free of charge (and thus, free of MY responsibility - you can't hold me accountable for any adverse effects from using my files). Most of them are already-existed melodies, interpolated through MY BRAIN and "translated" through my hands to either the keyboard of a piano or the keyboard of a computer. So don't worry, you won't be hunted down for copyright violation if you use my rewritten melodies in your projects.

# How I recorded my youtube videos...

Desperate time yields desperate measure. I'm poor, but lucky enough to have access to some very nice resource nearby. And yes, it's midnight time if you're wondering.

# Ain't we already have open source music?
A quick googling of the term "open source music" will probably land you here: https://snapmuse.com/insights/open-source-music-for-videos-and-podcasts.

However, like it or not, those are NOT fully open-sourced, because what you can freely download are the final audio files, NOT a specific set of instructions/codes to CREATE such audio files. They are equivalent to free software readily to be downloaded, but not the source codes. Hence, I hereby commence the Open Source Melody Initiative, in which the free-to-downloads are not just the audio files, but also the melody sheets and trackers used to construct those audio files. I found that the two most common way to show the melody constructions are (1) music sheets, which are nowadays very well-handled by Musescore format, and (2) tracker music files, which many game-makers are very familiar with, and are well-supported by OpenMPT format. Feel free to modify the music sheets and trackers if you think you can do it better than me :)

# How to get the final "rasterized" audio files?
There are several ways: 
- Use OpenMPT to open the tracker music file (.mo3), then go to File --> Stream Export. Choose your favorite format and settings.
- Use Musescore to open the music sheet file (.mscz), then go to File --> Export. Choose among MP3/Wave/FLAC export options.
- Use a youtube ripping tool (yt-dlp, for example - google it for more detail) to download the audio portion of my uploaded youtube videos associated with each melody.

# Musescore and OpenMPT
- Musescore (to open .mscz files): https://musescore.org/en
- OpenMPT (to open .mo3 files):https://openmpt.org/

See below for the map of OpenMPT channels to fingers.

# You can thank me later
All of my files are free for you to use and prosper upon. I don't stick ads to my youtube uploads (because I can't tell you how much I hate ads - that's a completely different story), so you can enjoy my videos without any interruption - and do not even need to rip audio from them.
